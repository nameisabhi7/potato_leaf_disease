# potato_leaf_disease
This model uses a deep learning technique called Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify different diseases in potato plant leaves. CNNs are good at learning patterns from images. The model is trained on labeled images of healthy and diseased potato leaves. It has multiple layers that extract features like edges, shapes, and textures from the images. After learning these features, the model can classify a new leaf image as healthy or diseased. You likely used techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning to improve the model's performance. The trained CNN model can help farmers detect potato leaf diseases early, allowing timely treatment and better crop yield. The model is built using the TensorFlow framework, which provides tools for building and training deep learning models.
